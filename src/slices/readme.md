# Slices
The `Slices` folder contains Redux Toolkit slices, which are modular units of Redux state management. Each slice manages a specific piece of the global state, including actions, reducers, and selectors.

## Guidelines

- Organize slices based on the feature or entity they represent.
- Clearly define actions, reducers, and selectors within each slice.
- Document the purpose of each slice and its interactions with the global state.
