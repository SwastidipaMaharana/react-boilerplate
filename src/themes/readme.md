# Themes

The `Themes` folder contains theme files defining the visual style of the application. Themes may include color schemes, font styles, and other design-related properties.

## Guidelines

- Create separate theme files for different visual variations.
- Document the properties and usage of each theme.
- Specify how themes can be switched or customized.
