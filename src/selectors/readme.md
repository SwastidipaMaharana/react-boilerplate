# Selectors

Selectors are functions used to retrieve and derive data from the application state. This folder may include various data manipulation functions used by the application.

## Guidelines

- Organize selectors based on the data they retrieve.
- Keep selectors pure and avoid side effects.
- Document the purpose and usage of each selector.
