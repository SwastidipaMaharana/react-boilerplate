# Routes

The `Routes` folder contains modules or configuration files related to the routing of the application. This includes defining routes, navigation structures, and any related utility functions.

## Guidelines

- Organize route files based on the application's navigation structure.
- Document the purpose of each route file and the routes it manages.
- Include information on route parameters, guards, and any middleware used.
