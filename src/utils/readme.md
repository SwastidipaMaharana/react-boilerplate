# Utils

The `Utils` folder contains utility functions and helper modules that provide common functionality across different parts of the application.

## Guidelines

- Keep utility functions focused on a specific task or set of related tasks.
- Organize utils into subfolders based on functionality if needed.
- Document the purpose and usage of each utility module or function.
- Include information on dependencies or related utilities.
