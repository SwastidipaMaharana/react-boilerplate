# Styles

The `Styles` folder contains TypeScript files (`styles.ts`) that define the visual styling and theming for the application. These styles are often used in conjunction with components to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the user interface.

## Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type-safe styling to enhance maintainability.
- Organize style files based on the components or sections they style.
- Document the purpose and usage of each style file.
